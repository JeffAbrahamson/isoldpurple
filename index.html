    The annals say: when the monks of Clonmacnoise<br>
    Were all at prayers inside the oratory<br>
    A ship appeared above them in the air.<br>
    <br>
    The anchor dragged along behind so deep<br>
    It hooked itself into the altar rails<br>
    And then, as the big hull rocked to a standstill,<br>
    <br>
    A crewman shinned and grappled down the rope<br>
    And struggled to release it. But in vain.<br>
    "This man can't bear our life here and will drown,"<br>
    <br>
    The abbot said, "unless we help him." So<br>
    They did, the freed ship sailed, and the man climbed back<br>
    Out of the marvellous as he had known it.<br>
